AKASh (Andy Kharbandy's Average Shell)
======================================

A totally average shell program that is an acronym and only coincidentally also the name of a man.

## Installation

Akash only installs on linux and requires gcc and make.

Copy/Download the source code. Change directories into the source code and run `sudo make install`.

Since Akash is still in development, it will be installed in `/usr/bin`

You'll be able to type `$ akash` to start akash.

The program `beemoviescript` will also install in he same directory.
